# USB-C-Everything
A small board for adding usb-c to any 5V device properly

- The board is short in the front to help the port stick through thicker plastic.
- There are resistor pads on both sides of the PCB to allow you to move them out of the way if need be(only use 2 resistors total, see example pictures)  

- **Order a board thickness of 0.8mm or smaller if your fab allows. Remember, the thinner the board is, the easier it will be to fit in things.**

# The pbcb  
Small boards for adding usb-c to any 5V device properly  

**The pbcb**  
- This boards small. *how small is it?* So small I had to put multiple so it'd be big enough for pcb fabs to make it.
- It's no bigger than the port itself.  
- Can be printed small enough the resistors can face the port itself instead of sticking off the back.  
- Through hole port for strength, keeping the entire thing small, allow for one sided assembly of the resistors so you dont have to solder those on yourself, makes it more noob friendly.  
- has large copper areas to help prevent pad burnoff, making it more noob friendly to put together/use  
- Use a max board thickness 0.8mm.

- [Order from OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/e9DyghlC)
- [Port](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_Yuandi-_C2689839.html). For the resistor you can use any 5.1kÎ©.  
- BOM and Pick and Place files are provided

# The pbcb Surface mount  
- The board is short in the front to help the port stick through thicker plastic.
- There's resistor pads on both sides of the PCB to allow you to move them out of the way if need be(only use 2 resistors total, see example pictures)  

- **Order a board thickness of 0.8mm or smaller if your fab allows. Remember, the thinner the board is the easier it'll be to fit in things.**
